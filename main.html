      <h3 style="color:orange", class="p1"><b>Brief introduction on Microservice Anomaly Detection </b></h3><br>
      <p style="color:red;" class="c" class="p1">Microservices architecture (often shortened to microservices) refers to an architectural style for developing applications. Microservices allow a large application to be separated into smaller independent parts, with each part having its own realm of responsibility. To serve a single user request, a microservices-based application can call on many internal microservices to compose its response.</p>
      <p style="color:red;" class="c" class="p1">Typically, microservices are used to speed up application development. Microservices architectures built using Java are common, especially Spring Boot ones. It’s also common to compare microservices versus service-oriented architecture. Both have the same objective, which is to break up monolithic applications into smaller components, but they have different approaches.
        Here are some microservices architecture examples: </p>
      <p style="color:red;" class="c" class="p1">As microservices environments continue to grow in size and complexity, they create bigger challenges for DevOps teams working to monitor the health and behavior of their systems. New Relic recently announced the general availability of a new feature that addresses this challenge: anomaly detection for distributed tracing.
                                                  Anomaly detection automatically surfaces the anomalous parts of a trace, which allows customers to find and focus directly on sources of latency. It’s one in a series of New Relic releases devoted to distributed tracing improvements, including condensed trace views, deployment markers, and trace groupings—all of which help DevOps teams understand and troubleshoot microservices environments more quickly. Distributed tracing helps you understand how requests flow through your microservices environment. This capability makes distributed tracing useful for finding sources of latency and errors within these environments. By tracing a request as it goes from one service to another, and timing the duration of important operations within each service, you get a complete picture of any performance issues or bottlenecks that impact the request within a distributed system.</p>
